# SSH Terminal UI — Security Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and uncomment the settings you want to enable.
# All settings are opt-in. If not set, the app runs with open access (no auth).

# --- Web UI Login ---
# Set a password to require login before accessing the terminal.
# If not set, the web UI is open to anyone who can reach the port.
# SSH_TERMINAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-password-here

# --- Session Settings ---
# How long (in minutes) before an idle session expires. Default: 30
# SSH_TERMINAL_SESSION_TIMEOUT=30

# Secret key for signing session cookies.
# If not set, a random key is generated on each server start
# (which means all sessions invalidate on restart).
# Set this to a stable value for persistent sessions across restarts.
# Generate one with: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# SSH_TERMINAL_SECRET_KEY=

# --- IP Allowlist ---
# Comma-separated list of IPs or CIDR ranges allowed to connect.
# If not set, all IPs are allowed.
# Examples:
#   Single IP:       SSH_TERMINAL_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.100
#   Subnet:          SSH_TERMINAL_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.0/24
#   Multiple:        SSH_TERMINAL_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.0/24,100.64.0.0/10,10.0.0.5
# SSH_TERMINAL_ALLOWED_IPS=

# --- Server ---
# Host and port to bind to. Default: 0.0.0.0:2222
# SSH_TERMINAL_HOST=0.0.0.0
# SSH_TERMINAL_PORT=2222

# --- Built-in HTTPS/TLS ---
# Set both to enable HTTPS. If either is missing, runs in HTTP mode.
# Works with: python3 app.py (not needed with uvicorn CLI — use --ssl-certfile/--ssl-keyfile there)
#
# Generate a self-signed cert for testing:
#   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
#
# SSH_TERMINAL_SSL_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem
# SSH_TERMINAL_SSL_KEY=/path/to/key.pem
